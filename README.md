# CarLoadingUnloading
 This C program simulates a scenario where a car, with limited capacity, takes multiple passengers for a ride. Passengers eagerly await their turn to board, and the car can only depart when fully occupied. The simulation involves modeling the car and passengers as threads, with tasks such as loading, running, and unloading.
